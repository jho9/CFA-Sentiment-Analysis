11018,@usairways you gladly take the loyal customers money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.,-1
11019,@usairways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. you are ruining peoples memories! you should be ashamed!,-1
11020,@usairways 1st a late flight plane then missing flight crew then maintenance problems gates switched 4 times. you call this customer service??,-1

11393,@usairways what is the point of a baggage claim ticket if they do not scan it  for tracking?,-1
11394,@usairways no access to dividend miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back late flightr. frustrated livepersonplease,-1
11395,@usairways you cannot even track my bag to see where it is. it is like it is disappeared.,-1
11396,@usairways cannot get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. it is been over a month since travel amp; I have submitted twice online,-1

11405,@usairways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?,-1
11406,@usairways so mad i cannot even believe  you guys cancelled flight my connecting flight after i leave the first stop amp; give me a useless hotel voucher,-1
11407,@usairways priorities should have been made. considering a pending snow storm why delay a flight for an hour amp; a half? I would like an answer.,-1
11408,@usairways: i experienced what defines customer service on flt1999. a flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges,-1

11418,@usairways the only way to assist is to actually answer the phone.,-1
11419,@usairways would it kill you to give me 3060 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?,-1
11420,@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?,-1
11421,@usairways would it kill you to not let 3000 miles expire,-1
